# Automated-Data-Integration-Reporting
This project consolidates data from various departments and platforms into a unified reporting system.
# Data Integration & Workflow Automation

Automating the process of syncing departmental spreadsheets into a central SQL database.

## Goal
- Eliminate manual entry
- Ensure consistent and real-time data flow
- Reduce human error

## Tools
- Google Sheets API
- SQL Server
- Excel Macros (VBA)

## Features
- Fetches new data weekly via script
- Runs integrity checks before database insertion
- Logs sync activity for auditing

## SQL Sample
```sql
MERGE INTO central_db AS target
USING source_sheet AS src
ON target.user_id = src.user_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT ...
Outcome
Saved 10+ hours/week in manual reporting

Reduced reporting errors by 85%

Enabled real-time decision-making

# Maintenance Logs Data Analysis

A data analytics project using downtime logs to improve equipment uptime through fault pattern detection.

## Context
Internship project from Fertilizer and Superphosphate Company

## Tools
- R
- Excel
- CSV logs

## Process
1. Collected equipment logs
2. Cleaned missing entries and structured data
3. Built histograms and failure trend reports

## R Sample Code
```r
hist(equipment_downtime$hours, breaks=10, 
     main="Downtime Distribution", col="steelblue")
Outcome
Improved uptime by 25%

Provided basis for preventative maintenance scheduling

### üì∏ **Visuals**
- Histogram in R: Save as `downtime_histogram.png`
- Include sample dataset like `downtime_data.csv`
